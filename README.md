# Automated Grading and Feedback Tools for Programming: A Systematic Review

Data processing and validation for the paper titled "Automated Grading and Feedback Tools for Programming
Education: A Systematic Review" published in the ACM Transactions on Computing Education.

All the data is stored within the 'data' directory, including:
 - raw data of all the decisions and annotations made by the two screeners,
 - processed data ready for visualisation
 - subsets of data utilised for specific visualisations or other work

The data extraction notebook processes the annotated data into a dataset that can be visualised for the results and discussion. The results and discussion notebooks are used to output the visualisations and the data used within the results and discussions sections.

To replicate the data processing and visualisation steps, run the notepads from start to finish in the following order:
1. data extraction
2. results
3. discussion
